This is a simple to-do list app built using React and TypeScript for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database.
The app is containerized using Docker and can be deployed using `docker-compose`.

## Features

- Create new todo items
- Mark todo items as completed
- Delete todo items
- Filter todo items by search
- Automatically sync with the backend every minute

## Prerequisites

- Docker and docker-compose installed on your machine
